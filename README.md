# Crypto-News-Sentiment

This Is A introductionary Project going through Data Mining and Sentiment Analysis. I mine data and get the title, date, content for a specific coin. 

I then run a pretrained library to graph sentiments

This Model also compares the Log Returns with the average sentiment direction to see direction matches

Future Ideas:

  - Get more Data
  - See if this can be used as a signal to trade when new news comes out
  - See how long news reaction(if any) stay in the market and for how long
  - See how variations of the same news from different sources affect sentiment and markets
  - Use Finbert or other libraries and compare sentiments and see accuracy differences
